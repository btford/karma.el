# karma.el

> Karma Test Runner Emacs Integration

## Installation

### ELPA

Karma.el is available on community maintained repository - [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/)

Just run `M-x package-install [RET] karma [RET]` inside your emacs and you're ready to go.

If you're not already using ELPA, check the [emacswiki](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA) page to get
familiar with it.

### Manual

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/karma.el/")
(require 'karma)
```

## Usage

### Basic setup

You need to create an `.karma` file inside your project directory to inform
Karma.el where to get the Karma config file and the Karma executable.

```json
{
  "config-file": "karma.coffee",
  "karma-command": "node_modules/karma/bin/karma"
}
```

The `config-file` and the `karma-command` paths need to be relative or absoulte
to the your project directory.
